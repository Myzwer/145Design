    <p class = "text-white py-2 text-left">Hey there! My name is Josh. I’m a full time web developer outside of Knoxville, TN. I work for Foothills Church as their web developer and I freelance on the side. I have around 4 years of experience in this field and love what I do.</p>
    <p class = "text-white py-2  text-left">Creative people tend to be night owls, and I am no exception to that rule. 145 Design was started because the wee hours of the morning are not only when I make websites, but also my preferred time to be awake. </p>
    <p class = "text-white py-2 text-left">In my free time you can find me playing computer games, board games or prepping for our next session of D&D. I also enjoy cheering on my favorite eSports team (cloud9), and listening to pop punk music because “the phase” never ended for me.</p>
    <p class = "text-white py-2 text-left">I have been married to my sweet wife Katie for 4 years now, and we currently live just outside of Knoxville, TN with our 3 pets, Ahri, Xayah and Lux.</p>
